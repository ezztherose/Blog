get complicated, even with a single computation has multiple stets to com-
plete before the calculation of the data can begin. This paper provides
a solution to run computations on a large data set with the complicated
aspect. MapReduce is a set of functions Map and Reduce, this set of
functions provide abstraction to automate memory management and par-
allelization across large designed clusters, with built in failure handling.</p><h2 id=1-introduction>1. Introduction</h2><p>The new era of computing large scale data sets were a huge undertaking and unorganized. The collection of raw
data had stared to set roots. The collected data were documents, logs, etc. Every time there was a need for some
type of computation, the developers were forced to develop for the specific data set, i.e. developers had to consider
parallelization, fault tolerance. This special code-bases were costly and and the developers required special technical
skills to execute the code in a cluster. Other complications developers could encounter are memory management, I/O bus
overflow. Furthermore, the data had to be distributed amongst a cluster of nodes (computers). Otherwise would the
computation not be finished in a reasonable time frame.</p><p>To solve the problem for running large data set on a cluster, the code complexity had to be chipped down by abstraction.
The goal were to hide away the complex code parts and automate the complex processes and to create a framework.
The framework they came up with was called <em>MapReduce</em>. <em>MapReduce</em> contains two functions: <em>Map</em> and <em>Reduce</em>.
<em>MapReduce</em> was introduced to remove the special designed solutions, and to create a simplified general solution able
to be implemented on a cluster with a variety of data sets. This simplification made it easy and more available for less
experienced developers to adapt.</p><h2 id=2-implementation>2. Implementation</h2><p><em>MapReduce</em> is a set of functions that contains: <em>Map</em> & <em>Reduce</em>. The <em>Map</em> function takes an <em>input</em> in the
form as an input/value pair. The goal is to associate values that have the same key I. The <em>Reduce</em> produce an <em>output</em>
of key/value pairs. The <em>Reduce</em> function accepts the key I and its associated values. Afterwards, <em>Reduce</em> merge
the values to possible reduce the data into a smaller data set.</p><p>To make any sort of computations on a large data set there are a few structural p
arts of the cluster that needs to be considered. The structural parts for <em>MapReduce</em>
are the following : one master node, and worker nodes (Map-workers and Reduce-workers). Furthermore,
the master node do have some limitations, when the master node performers scheduling, which require a
complexity <em>O(M + R)</em> and a complexity of <em>O(M * R)</em> for the memory state. The worker nodes have
two properties: an id, and a state. The state contains of three different sub-states during execution (<em>idle</em>,
<em>in-progress</em> and <em>complete</em>). An input file is split up into chunks and sent to the Map-workers (MW) and
apply a computation defined by the user, see Figure 1. The result from these computations are stored locally on
the MW. The MW changes there sate from <em>in-process</em> to <em>complete</em>, the master node gets notified by the
completion and give the path where the MW has stored their data to the Reduce-workers (RW). The RW then output R files.</p><p><img src=/static/imgs/mapreduce/workflow.png alt="img of the workflow"></p><blockquote><p>Figure 1. An overview of a cluster with a MapReduce design.</p></blockquote><p>Figure 1 is a simplified view of the structural design of how <em>MapReduce</em> work. It starts with an input file at the left. The data file is then traveling through the MW&rsquo;s, continuing towards the RW&rsquo;s which finally produces the output files as mentioned earlier. The master node does ping all the nodes to keep the up-time and computations under control.</p><p>However, to assure the optimal workflow for the nodes, there is a condition that must be met. Since <em>Map</em> is divided into into <em>M</em> chunks, and the <em>Reduce</em> into <em>R</em> chunks. <em>M</em> and <em>R</em> should preferably be substantial larger than the amount of nodes in the cluster.</p><p>The different states mentioned above, are important for the fault tolerance of the cluster. The master node is configured to ping the workers during the computations. However, if a node do not respond in set time frame, the master node does fail the worker node and assign the task to another free node. The failed nodes is then put into an <em>idle</em> state to get new task assigned. When the node have achieved a <em>complete</em> state, the content of the local disk is moved to a global storage system. This structure design of the cluster makes it resilient towards failures amongst the worker nodes.</p><h2 id=3-experiment>3. Experiment</h2><p>Two experiments were conducted in the paper. The first one was a sort and the second is a searches. However, since the paper is from 2008, the technology used are low performing for today&rsquo;s standard.</p><p>The internal network were designed as a tree with two levels. The total theoretical speed the network including the aggregated bandwidth were approximate 100-200 Gb/s. Each of the nodes were configured with an 1Gb/s network port. All the testing were conducted within the same building.</p><h3 id=31-sort>3.1 Sort</h3><p>The authors created a program based on a benchmark (TeraSort) to conduct the test. The program is designed to sort approximately one terabyte of data. The main goal is to send the data into the <em>MapReduce</em> which give the data indexes the data (key/value, see Solution). Afterwards, the program splits the data chunks and perform the same sort again. The input file was divided into 64MB chunks, a total of <em>M = 15000</em>. The output file was divided into <em>R = 4000</em> separate files. The <em>Map</em> complete executing under 200 seconds for $10^{10}$ 100-bytes, and the input rate is 13 GB/s (13000 MB/s) compared to a single HDD (Hard Disk Drive) which have a theoretical write speed between 126-160 MB/s depending on sort of workload the drive are designed for. Each node within the cluster had an IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) disk with a total size of 160GB.</p><h3 id=32-search>3.2 Search</h3><p>The search experiment was based on <em>grep</em>, grep is a scanning program, who searches for patterns withing characters.
The file size for the <em>grep</em> program is the same size as the sort ($10^{10}$ 100-bytes). The input file was divided into 64MB chunks, a total of <em>M = 15000</em>. The output file was only <em>R = 1</em> (one single file) file. <em>Grep</em> searched with a speed of 30 GB/s (30000 MB/s) with a cluster size of 1764 workers. The actual <em>search</em> completed in approximately 80 seconds, and the overall time for the search was around 150 seconds. Including startup for the cluster, and overhead. The overhead bases form the opening and searching through all input files, to gather enough information for optimization.</p><p>The search has a higher input rate compared to the sort experiment. This is because of the I/O bandwidth when the <em>Map task</em> is writing to its local storage (it takes approximately half of the time).</p><h2 id=4-mapreduces-impact>4. MapReduce&rsquo;s impact</h2><p><em>MapReduce</em> have been applied in many different research projects. One paper who uses machine learning (ML) to detect strokes applied <em>MapReduce</em> to accelerate the processing time. <em>MapReduce</em> achieve this by its efficiency to handle large amount of data.</p><p>Researchers have applied <em>MapReduce</em> in data mining to extract hidden information in data in the energy field. By applying <em>MapReduce</em> results in processing on large amount data, which results in finding e.g. associations between data points. However, if there are more nodes than data, an issue for the cluster to load balance the workload. Load balancing is a method to balance the workload as evenly as possible amongst the nodes This means that the cluster runs optimal when all nodes within the cluster are assigned a workload, hence there needs to more data than nodes.</p><p>If the master node does fail during execution, the <em>MapReduce</em> abort the execution and the user needs to look into the masters current condition and then re-execute the program.</p><h2 id=5-conclusion>5. Conclusion</h2><p><em>MapReduce</em> have had an successful impact for handling large amount of data, this method has been applied in machine learning to as well e.g. to extract information for the model. Furthermore, the developers made it easy for none-specialist to apply the method through abstraction, in other words restrictions were introduced for the programming model (<em>MapReduce</em>), hence made it easy for adoption. The prevention of redundant executions can help to reduce slow nodes.</p><p>There are no details of the specific type of HDD used only that it is an IDE disk, however the speed achieved from combining multiple nodes is an enormous increase in compute speed comparing to computing a single computer.</p><p>Moreover, if there are smaller data sets, there is a possibility to use a smaller amount of nodes to achieve optimal conditions for the cluster. However, there will be an decrease of compute power to achieve the load balancing, this balancing is a choice the developer must make.</p><h2 id=references>References</h2><p>[1] Hdd features & benefits. <a href=https://www.westerndigital.com/solutions/internal-hdd>https://www.westerndigital.com/solutions/internal-hdd</a>.
