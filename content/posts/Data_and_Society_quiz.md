## Questions 

**Qusestion 1:** *What is data?*
- [ ] Facts that we can measure quantitatively 
- [ ] Knowledge that we can acquire from reliable sources 
- [x] Facts and statistics collected for further analysis 
- [ ] Information collected from reliable sources

**Question 2:** *According to Kitchin, data is not a "given" but a "taken? What does he mean?*
- [ ] Data is not a natural resource
- [ ] It takes a lot energy to collect data
- [ ] Data is out there for us to collect if we need
- [x] Data are construed, recorded, and collected as the result of human decisions

**Question 3:** *Why do we need to clean data?*
- [ ] Data might have outliers. 
- [ ] Data might be invalid. 
- [ ] There might be a loss of data.   
- [x] All of the other answers.

**Question 4:** *What makes data objectivity challenging?*
- [x] Measuring and collecting data involves interpretation and value judgements. 
- [ ] Not using direct observation properly during data collection. 
- [ ] Not using proper data collection tools. 
- [ ] Our inclination to use judgements of value. 

**Question 5:** *Can we equate data neutrality and data objectivity?*
- [x] No, they are different concepts. 
- [ ] Partly, because neutrality depends on objectivity. 
- [ ] Yes, because both presuppose human detachment. 
- [ ] Partly, because data objectivity can result in neutrality

> Correct. Neutrality too is a value judgment and not always the most objective one. Sometimes, it is neutrality that represents bias.

**Question 6:** *Which of the following characterizes the notion of data as discussed in this course?*
- [ ] Data is a stable object ready for use. 
- [ ] Given a lot of data, useful and reliable discoveries would follow with no need for interpretation.
- [x] Data moves from sites of creation to sites of analysis and interpretation. 
- [ ] Data practices are the same regardless of the sector and area. 

**Question 7:** *Which of the following could improve facial recognition?*
- [ ] The training data should be more varied for the AI system but we cannot generate enough data about women and people of color.
- [x] Better representation of women and people of color in the data that trains AI. 
- [ ] Machine will always discriminate no matter the data used for training. 
- [ ] Humans intervene to rectify faulty facial recognition matches. 

**Question 8:** *Which of the following explains why datafication is not only about data?*
- [x] It is composed of four layers, including data in different forms.uding data, 
- [ ] It requires regulation to intervene in specific sectors. 
- [ ] It requires human and technical capacity to handle data. 
- [ ] It focuses also on the individual rights of the data subjects.

**Question 9:** *Why should we challenge the reification of datafied identities?*
- [ ] We should challenge non-objective classifications. 
- [ ] Because we all have multiple identities and we cannot fit a single classification 
- [x] When constructing and categorise data, system developers can treat socially constructed and negotiated categories of identity as fixed.
- [ ] We should not challenge reification because categorising identities is a useful and easy way to sort data.

**Question 10:** *Which of the following is considered a form of unintentional data pollution?*
- [x] Encoding societal biases and prejudices in a dataset 
- [ ] Including data pollutants in a training set by mistake. 
- [ ] Not including greener data in a training dataset. 
- [ ] Not taking an ethical stance on data

**Question 11:** *What are important aspects for platforms to work/ to 'platform'?*
- [x] Their role as intermediaries, application programming interfaces and a business model   
- [ ] Their role as standalone, diconnected actors that benefit from users' interaction with the GUI to generate data points.
- [ ] The creation and provision of content, the use of application programming interfaces and means for revenue

**Question 12:** *What is platformization?*
- [ ] The technical re-configuration of websites into platforms. 
- [ ] Using a platform as a base to build or use software or another platform on top of it
- [x] The omnipresence always changing platforms in most spheres of social life and the re-organization of social life according to platform logics.

**Question 12:** *What characterizes the digitalization of the 21th century, according to the 'digital trinity'?*
- [ ] A stronger stance taken by national, supra-national and global actors to adress Artificial Intelligence   
- [x] A spiral of interconnected platformization, datafication and algorithmization 
- [ ] The increasingly distributed role of individuals, the community and governments. when it comes to questions and concerns about digital data use.
