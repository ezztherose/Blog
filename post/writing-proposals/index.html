However, manually processing and finding associations in large amounts of data can be a time-consuming and tedious task. It can also be difficult to identify connections between multiple large data sets. With the use of advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, this task can be made much easier and more efficient.</p><p>Mikrobiota is a term that greps all the microorganisms which are situated within the same place. Furthermore, the larger eukaryotic organism where the mikro- biota organisms are habitat are called the host, i.e. viruses and bacteria are human microbiota. The estimations for the amount of microba within a hu- man body is approximatly 500 to 1000 different species of bacteria. Moreover, each bacteria does contains a strain with a genome which are structured with thousands of genes.</p><p>Clinical data are collected from patients from preformed experiments in different forms or data generated from doctors appointments. The clinical data needs to have correspondence with the experiment, in other terms the data has to repre- sent the real world in an objective point of view. There is a difference between the data (normal/general) and clinical data. All the analysis conducted for clinical data, it is important to set rules for diseases, treatment and prognostic, hence providing good and high quality of the data is prioritized when working with clinical data. However, there are a few issues when working with clinical data. One of the issues are the different goals, more specific the scientific goal with the clinical data. Is the data enough for the research. The other issue are the biases from the researchers
.
RNA (ribonucleic acid) is the building-block of the almost every living organ- isms and viruses respectively. RNA molecules can varies is length and its form (structure). RNA is common in RNA viruses since the RNA viruses uses the RNA to affect the host instead of the DNA as the genetic building-block, hence can be causes diseases towards humans. Transforming from DNA towards RNA is a process to synthesis protein from the actual RNA. Moreover, there are a difference between the eukaryotes and prokaryotes. To be more precise, the RNA molecule does also have the attribute to control the expressions of a gene. Hence can possible be an agents within diseases for humans.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been applied in many areas. AI have played a huge role in when associating microbial and despises. However, these results are sill complicated to interpret. The rapid development of AI techniques, i.e. Machine Learning (ML) & Deep Learning (DL), can process and predict from large data sets.</p><p>There are a philosophical premise used as a guideline: working with clinical data have one intention, the use of the data should provide care. The data needs to be fulfilled. In other words, the collected data should be seen as public good, and its purpose is to help patients in the future.</p><h2 id=data>Data</h2><p>In this study, we will be utilizing a combination of microbiota, RNA-sequence, and clinical data obtained from the Shalgrenska Hospital. It should be noted that these data are not publicly available, as they contain sensitive medical information of patients. To the best of our knowledge, there are no comparable datasets readily available. Despite this, there has been growing interest in using Artificial Intelligence and machine learning techniques to predict disease patterns and monitor outbreaks in the medical field. This project aims to contribute to these efforts by exploring the potential associations between the data sets.</p><h2 id=problem>Problem</h2><p>The problem this study is designed to map pathogenesis, the project is con- structed as following:

Lastly, the variety is the different forms the raw data are collected. These three V’s have been defined as standard for big data. However, there are one more V emerging (forth V), veracity which is focusing on the accuracy and reliability of the collected data.</p><p>AI has gained a lot of popularity within the healthcare, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. By applying machine learning, it was possible to make predictions for high-risk areas for further outbreaks. By combining health care data and AI have improve many areas within the health care, i.e., real-time monitoring of infections. Furthermore, AI in healthcare has opened new possibilities in improving patient outcomes. One of the ways this is achieved is by using AI-based techniques in diagnostics and other areas of healthcare. This has led to the development of new and innovative methods that have the potential to revolutionize the way we approach healthcare. The goal of this study is to explore the use of AI in healthcare and evaluate its effectiveness in improving clinical outcomes.</p><p>Unsupervised learning is a powerful machine learning technique that can be used to analyze and classify unlabelled data without human interference. The aim of this method is to uncover hidden patterns or relationships within the data itself, using various machine learning algorithms. This approach can be useful for a range of applications such as exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation, image and pattern recognition. Some of the most common algorithms used in unsupervised learning include neural networks, k-means clustering, and probabilistic clustering methods are also used to reduce the number of features in a model. Unsupervised learning can be a powerful tool for extracting insights from large and complex datasets, and can be used in a variety of industries and applications.</p><h2 id=goals-and-challenges>Goals and Challenges</h2><p>The goal is to be exploring the Complexities of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: This Study Aims to Utilize Machine Learning Algorithms to Identify Correlations Among Data Sets and Uncover the Multifactorial Disease Pathogenesis. The task of analyzing large amounts of data can be challenging, especially when the data do not come with pre-defined labels. In such cases, unsupervised learning can prove to be an effective approach. This method allows the identification of patterns within the data that might have been missed or overlooked when using traditional supervised learning techniques. In this study, we aim to utilize unsupervised learning to uncover hidden patterns in our data set, which could lead to new insights and understanding of the underlying phenomena.</p><p>The current study is faced with both theoretical and technical challenges that may impact its progress and outcome. Theoretical challenges stem from the nature of the data being analyzed, including the types of data (microbiota, clinical and RNA), their quality, and the difficulties in obtaining access to clinical data. On the other hand, technical challenges relate to computational resources, including the availability and efficiency of computing power for running the data analysis, and the possibility of needing to utilize a cluster for larger data sets.</p><h2 id=approach>Approach</h2><h3 id=methodology>Methodology</h3><p>In this study, we aim to develop a machine learning model that will be able to predict correlations between microbiota, clinical, and RNA data. To begin, the data will undergo a cleaning process, which is estimated to take one to two weeks. During this phase, the data will be tested using a simple linear regression approach to ensure its suitability for longer training runs. After the initial testing stage, descriptive statistics will be performed on the data. Next, a subset of the cleaned data will be created, and machine learning models will be developed. The subset of the data will be utilized to train the models and hyper-parameter tuning will be conducted to optimize the model. Upon completion of the training phase, the results will be analyzed to assess the accuracy of the model&rsquo;s predictions and determine if further training is required. Additionally, statistical analysis will be performed to supplement our findings.</p><h3 id=evaluation>Evaluation</h3><p>In this study, we aim to thoroughly evaluate the predictive capability of our machine learning model by utilizing a portion of our data for validation purposes. This reserved data will serve as an independent assessment tool and will not be involved in the training process. By conducting a correlation analysis between various data points, we aim to confirm the validity and reliability of the model&rsquo;s predictions. This evaluation process will allow us to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying patterns and relationships within the data and enable us to detect any potential discrepancies or inaccuracies in our model&rsquo;s output. The outcomes of this validation process will significantly contribute to the refinement and improvement of our model and provide valuable insights into the complex relationships between microbiota, clinical, and RNA data.</p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ul><li><p>[1] Zodwa Dlamini, Flavia Zita Francies, Rodney Hull, and Rahaba Marima.
